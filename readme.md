# 30 Days of Frontend

## Description

I started this repo to enhance my coding skills.
I always browse websites like [Behance](https://behance.net), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), and [Awwwards](https://awwwards.com) and I get inspired by all the good designs there. So I got an idea to enhance my skills by turning random designs on both [Behance](https://behance.net) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) into actual websites like those on [Awwwards](https://awwwards.com). And maybe one day I'll design my own websites and submit them to [Awwwards](https://awwwards.com).
I hope you find those projects useful if you're a beginner frontend developer, and If you have any suggestions or comments I'd be happy if you leave a comment or email me directly at <a href="mailto:abdo.achhoubi2@gmail.com">abdo.achhoubi2@gmail.com</a>
